# Home Office Forms Example Form

This is an example of a service built with [Home Office Forms](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hof), A.K.A HOF. It intends to highlight many of the features available from HOF, but is not exhaustive.

## Items of Note

This is not the only way to configure your HOF service. This service uses a typical Node.JS, Express architecture, with an entry point named `app.js`, which is where the majority of the set up occurs.

The specifics of a form are configured in `apps/`, this is where views, controllers, translations and the steps and fields are defined for each form journey (spoiler: there is only one at the moment).

For more info see the [HOF documentation](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hof/blob/master/documentation/index.md) or [join the discussion](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/hof/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisities

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 4 and up.
- npm version 3 (bundled with node 5 and up)
- [Redis server](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart) running on the default port
- A healthy understanding of Node.JS

  ```

4. Set the remote origin:

  ```
  git remote add origin <github-uri>
  git push -u --force origin master
